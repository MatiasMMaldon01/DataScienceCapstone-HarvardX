# DataScienceCapstone-HarvardX

HarvardX: PH125.9x: Data Science - Capstone

This repository was created to archive and share the two projects within the HarvardX Data Science Professional Certificate. Both projects have the three required files (.R file, .Rmd file, and a PDF file), the images (images folder), and, in the case of IBMHREmployeeAttrition, have the dataset used (.csv file).

## Movie Lens - Recommendation System
The purpose of this project is creating a recommendation system using the **MovieLens dataset** that beats a RMSE less than 0.86490.

This report sets out the exploratory analysis of the data using common visualization techniques followed by the methods used to develop, train and test the algorithm before providing and discussing the results from each iteration of the algorithm and concluding on the outcome of the final model and its limitations.

## IBMHREmployeeAttrition - Choose your Own

The purpose of this project is to investigate the employee attrition of a company and predicting the potential employees who would leave the company. We will be working with a dataset extracted from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/pavansubhasht/ibm-hr-analytics-attrition-dataset) called "IBM HR Analytics Employee Attrition & Performance".

To do this all, first we'll do some EDA (Explanatory Data Analysis) to get some intuition about the data. We then try to build different models with different techniques and compare their scores with different evaluation metrics. We finally fine tune our model in the best performing technique.
